# Edible mushrooms classifier - Log Regression

# 1. Dataset Overview

DataSource https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/mushroom-dataset/data

```
This data set contains 9 columns:
- Cap Diameter
- Cap Shape
- Gill Attachment
- Gill Color
- Stem Height
- Stem Width
- Stem Color
- Season
- Target Class - Is it edible or not?

The Target Class contains two values - 0 or 1 - where 0 refers to edible and 1 refers to poisonous.

```
# 2. Technical Requirements

**Libraries**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

# 3. Results

While a 0.64 accuracy might be acceptable in some contexts, but not for poisonous mushrooms, further improvements can be made to increase the confidence in the classifier's predictions. 

By refining the model and exploring additional techniques, you can strive for higher accuracy and a more reliable edible mushroom classifier.
